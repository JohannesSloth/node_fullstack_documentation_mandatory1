# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a web page viewed by other users. This can be done by injecting code into a form field, search field, or any other input field on a web page that is not properly sanitized.

For example, an attacker could inject malicious code into a comment field on a blog post that would execute when other users view the post.

To prevent XSS attacks, it's important to properly sanitize all user input to ensure that it cannot be executed as code.

## Sanitizing User Input

Sanitizing user input means removing or encoding any characters that could be used for malicious purposes, such as <, >, and &. One way to sanitize user input in JavaScript is by using a library called DOMPurify.

DOMPurify is a library that sanitizes HTML and prevents XSS attacks by removing any dangerous or unwanted tags and attributes from user input. Here's an example of how to use DOMPurify in a Node.js project:

1. Install DOMPurify using npm:

```javascript
npm install dompurify
```

2. Import DOMPurify and JSDOM into your project:

```javascript
const createDOMPurify = require('dompurify');
const { JSDOM } = require('jsdom');

const window = new JSDOM('').window;
const DOMPurify = createDOMPurify(window);
```
> JSDOM is a pure-JavaScript implementation of the DOM and HTML standards used in web browsers. It is used in the example to create a fake DOM environment that can be used by the DOMPurify library to sanitize user input.

3. Use DOMPurify to sanitize user input:

```javascript
const sanitizedHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

In this example, we first create a new JSDOM window and use it to create an instance of DOMPurify. We can then pass user input to the `sanitize` method of DOMPurify to sanitize it.

By properly sanitizing user input, you can help prevent XSS attacks and ensure the security of your web applications.
