# Deploying an Express Node.js Project on Vercel

Vercel is a popular cloud platform for deploying serverless functions and web applications. In this document, we'll cover how to deploy an Express Node.js project on Vercel, including step-by-step instructions and code snippets.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure that you have the following:

- An Express Node.js project that you want to deploy
- A Vercel account

### Step 1: Prepare your Project

Before we can deploy our project on Vercel, we need to make sure that it's set up correctly. Here are some steps to follow:

1. Make sure that your project has a `package.json` file that includes all of the necessary dependencies, including Express.
2. Create a file called `index.js` (or whatever you want to call your main file) that sets up your Express app and listens on a port. For example:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello World!');
   });

   app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, () => {
     console.log('Server listening on port 3000...');
   });
   ```

   This example sets up an Express app that responds with the message `'Hello World!'` when you visit the root URL. It also listens on the port specified in the `PORT` environment variable, or 3000 if no port is specified.

### Step 2: Deploy your Project

Now that your project is set up correctly, we can deploy it on Vercel. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard and create a new project.
2. Select your Git repository and connect it to your Vercel project.
3. Choose the appropriate settings for your project, including the branch to deploy and the build command to run.
4. Deploy your project.

Your Express Node.js project is now deployed on Vercel. You can visit the URL provided by Vercel to view your app.
