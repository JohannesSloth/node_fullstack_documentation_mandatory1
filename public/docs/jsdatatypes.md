# JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript has several data types that are used to store different kinds of values. Here are some of the most commonly used data types:

### Number

The `Number` data type is used to represent both integer and floating-point numbers in JavaScript.

```javascript
let myNumber = 42;
let myFloat = 3.14;
```

### String

The `String` data type is used to represent a sequence of characters. Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.

```javascript
let myString = 'Hello, world!';
let myOtherString = "This is another string.";
```

### Boolean

The `Boolean` data type is used to represent a logical value, either `true` or `false`.

```javascript
let myTrueBoolean = true;
let myFalseBoolean = false;
```

### Undefined

The `Undefined` data type represents a value that is undefined. It is typically used for variables that have not been assigned a value.

```javascript
let myUndefinedVariable;
```

### Null

The `Null` data type represents a value that is null, or empty.

```javascript
let myNullVariable = null;
```

### Object

The `Object` data type is used to represent a collection of related values, called properties.

```javascript
let myObject = { 
  name: 'John', 
  age: 42 
};
```

### Array

The `Array` data type is used to represent a collection of values, which can be of different data types.

```javascript
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 'four', true];
```

### Function

The `Function` data type is used to represent a block of code that can be executed.

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  console.log('This is a function!');
}
```

These are some of the most commonly used data types in JavaScript. It's important to understand the different data types so that you can use them appropriately in your programs.
