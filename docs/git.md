# Git
Git was created by Linus Torvalds, who also famously created the Linux Kernel.

In fact he (and others) created git as a means to manage the Linux project because of issues with the version control tool they had been using until then.

## Basic Git Commands
### clone
The clone command allows users to clone publicly posted repositories down to their own computers. 
> An extremely popular website for hosting project repositories is GitHub. Therefore our examples will also utilize this.
```
git clone <GitHub Repository URL>
```
The command will clone the remote repository to directory in which you are placed when running the command, unless otherwise specified, so be sure to be in an appropriate directory when running it.
